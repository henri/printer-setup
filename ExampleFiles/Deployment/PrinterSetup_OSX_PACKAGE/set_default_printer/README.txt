#   Set Default Printer Package System   #
##########################################

This directory contains tools to assist you with building a package which will set the default printer.

This directory may be ignored if you do not want to make PrinterSetup packages. It is only required (at present) for the generation of a package to set a specific queue to be the systems default.

If you would like to build a package which will set a printer to use a default printer simply copy (or link from the PrinterSetupFiles directory the PSF) the PSF into the PSF_default_printer_directory. If more than one file exists then the first one found will be used.

This system is very basic and is only really aimed (or should be used) for people who want to make a package which sets a package to configure the default printer on a system using a package. 

This entire feature may be removed from PrinterSetup in the future. It is essentially, a feature request.

If you require more advanced default printer settings, the following URL provides excellent information :

We look forward to your feed back so we can continue to improve this system.

Kind regards,
The Printing Works Team
