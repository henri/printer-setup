# Printer Setup #

PrinterSetup is an open source (GNU GPL) cups print queue management system. 

Excellent for CUPS Print queue deployment on BYOD, lab, server deployments and more. 

PrinterSetup supports CUPS print queue management on BSD, GNU/LINUX and macOS operating systems.

Printer setup allows you to define "Printer Setup Files". Each PSF, defines the configuration of a CUPS print queue. You also have the ability to define "Printer List Files". A PLF contains a list of printers, to be setup.
